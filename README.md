So this is basically another frontendmentor clone(yh i know i do way too much of those)
yh so it consisted of 3 major parts, date validation, age calculation and webpage design. 
The webpage design was the easiest for me duhh, since it's a clone. 
The  date validation was the hardest cause i had to use an external library that didn't have any documentation and because of that it was really tough, but after some chat-gpt finessing I finally got it to work, I was really happy.
I used react-hook-form for the form and yup for the validation. The age calculation was probably one that i enjoyed the most cause I had to essentially come up with an algorithm for calculating the ages and that was really fulfilling(btw it took me two days to come up with the algorithm and it took sipe longerüòè)
All in all, this was my toughest project but I definitely learnt a lot from it
